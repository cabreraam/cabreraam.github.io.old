# Welcome!

## Biographical Sketch
I am a Sotware Engineer in the [Future Technologies 
Group](https://csmd.ornl.gov/group/future-technologies) at [Oak Ridge National
Laboratory](https://www.ornl.gov/) and focus on hardware and systems in a
post-Moore landscape. I earned my Ph.D. in Computer Engineering 
at [Washington University in St. 
Louis](https://cse.wustl.edu/Pages/default.aspx), where I was advised by [Roger
Chamberlain](https://www.cse.wustl.edu/~roger/). My dissertation focused on
domain specific computing through leveraging FPGAs using high level synthesis
as a means to architect hardware for the domain of data integration. In
general, my research interests include heterogeneous systems, hardware
accelerators, high level synthesis, high performance computing, and computer
architecture.
